# Multithreading_In_JavaScript
A simple front end script for returning various colors of embroidery thread on the Shopify page for Embroidery Systems.
Test can be seen here:
https://www.embroiderysystems.com/pages/test-page

As the the script is written specifically for a specific Shopify page the file index.html written to test only specific functions. Updating the cart will not work on index.html but will function on the aforementioned Shopify page.
Additionally, CSS is handled on the live page to ensure that the elements inserted via JavaScript match the shop's styles/colors.

The name of the project is the stupidest pun I could come up with.
